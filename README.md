## Project Challenge
Nordstrom's goal is to provide customers the best service, and to modernize themselves to millenials. They struggle with keeping up with the new trends that millenials have to offer, which results in less interest to younger shoppers.

## Project Proposal
To resolve Nordstrom's situation, RAC will develop an QR Code reader function to Nordstrom's current app. By developing this function, it will modernize the way of how millenial shoppers and other users purchase clothes in store. To clarify, the QR Code reader will both diversify the store's way of buying clothing to their customers, and attract more customers (such as millenials) to the store with the new feature.
